# WingMan

WingMan is a simple, top-down, shoot 'em up game that I developed as one of two final projects for my software development (CSC413) class in fall 2013. WingMan is developed and maintained in Java via Netbeans.

The other final project is a two-player shooter game called Tank Wars, which shares some classes and components with WingMan.

Two players can cooperatively play WingMan.

## Controls

Player 1 shoots with CTRL and moves with the arrow keys.  
Player 2 shoots with LEFT SHIFT and moves with W (up), A (left), S (down), D (right).

## Gameplay

The objective is simple: destroy as many enemy aircraft!

As the game goes on, players will face more and more waves of enemies that gradually become tougher and more resilient.

### Health

Each player has health, and a health bar at the bottom of the screen displays a player's current health. A player's health gradually depletes upon sustaining damage from enemy fire or even crashing into enemy aircraft. Once a player loses all of his or her health, he or she loses a life.

### Lives

Each player has three lives; each player's number of lives are displayed, as small plane icons, right beside his or her respective health bars. Once a player loses all three of his or her lives, his or her game is over.

### Score

Furthermore, each player's score is displayed on his or her respective health bar. A player earns points based on the number of enemy aircraft destroyed, and how powerful the enemy aircraft was. Again, the objective is simple: destroy as many aircraft!

### Power-Ups

As players flies and fights through waves, they may fly across health packs (shown as a box with a red cross) that, when flown to and obtained, recover lost health, and a power up box (shown as a box with the letter P) that, when flown to and obtained, upgrade one's weapons such that he or she can fire three shots instead of one!

Use these items to your advantage!

Good luck!
